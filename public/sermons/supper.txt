1 Corinthians 11:26 - For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.

Matthew 26:26-28 - Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

1 Corinthians 10:16 - The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?

Acts 2:42 - And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

Luke 22:19-20 - And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.

John 6:27 Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.”

John 6:51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.”
John 6:52 At this, the Jews began to argue among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”
John 6:53 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, you have no life in you.
John 6:54 Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
John 6:55 For My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink.
John 6:56 Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.        
John 6:57 Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.
John 6:58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your fathers, who ate the manna and died, the one who eats this bread will live forever.”
