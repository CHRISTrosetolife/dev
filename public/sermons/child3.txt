There was a man named Israel

Israel eventually had 12 sons

One of the sons of Israel was named Joseph

God loves every person the same

God loves me and you and everyone else the same

God does not have any favorite humans

And parents should love each of their children the same

But Israel did not love all his sons the same

Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons

The brothers of Joseph were jealous that Israel loved Joseph more than them

The brothers of Joseph got angry at Joseph

The brothers of Joseph got so angry at Joseph that they wanted to hurt him

We should never hurt anyone else

We should always love other people

Love does not harm other people

The brothers of Joseph decided to sell Joseph as a slave

Israel lost Joseph

Israel lost his favorite son

Because Israel had a favorite, he lost his favorite and got hurt

If we don't love people well, then we will get hurt, too

We should always love everyone

We should remember everything belongs to God


Then Joseph went to Epypt

Being a slave is very difficult

When Joseph was a slave God was with Joseph

When we have difficulties in our lives, God is always with us

God blessed everything that Joseph did

The master of Joseph had a wife

The wife of the master of Joseph wanted Joseph to sin against her and the master

Joseph refused to sin against his master and the wife of his master

We must always obey God

Even if someone asks us to disobey God we must obey God

Then the wife of the master of Joseph lied and said Joseph hurt her

But Joseph did not hurt the wife of his master

But the master believed the wife

So Joseph went to prison

Being in prison is very difficult

Joseph did not deserve to be a slave or in prison

Sometimes God allows very bad things to happen to us that we do not deserve

If we do good and suffer, then later God will always bless us

Joseph was freed from prison and became ruler over Egypt

Then Joseph was very happy

If you are very sad, God can make you very happy

When Jesus returns we will be very happy
