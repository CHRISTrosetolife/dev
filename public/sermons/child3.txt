There was a man named Israel

Israel eventually had 12 sons

One of the sons of Israel was named Joseph

God loves every person the same

God does not have any favorite humans

And parents should love each of their children the same

But Israel did not love all his sons the same

Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons
