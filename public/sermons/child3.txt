There was a man named Israel

Israel eventually had 12 sons

One of the sons of Israel was named Joseph

God loves every person the same

God loves me and you and everyone else the same

God does not have any favorite humans

And parents should love each of their children the same

But Israel did not love all his sons the same

Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons

The brothers of Joseph were jealous that Irael loved Joseph more than them

The brothers of Joseph got angry at Joseph

The brothers of Joseph got so angry at Joseph that they wanted to hurt him

We should never hurt anyone else

We should always love other people

Love does not harm other people

The brothers of Jospeh decided to sell Jospeh as a slave

Then Joseph

Israel lost his favorite son because he had a favorite

If we have an idol it is hurt us
