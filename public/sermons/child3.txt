There was a man named Israel

Israel eventually had 12 sons

One of the sons of Israel was named Joseph

God loves every person the same

God loves me and you and everyone else the same

God does not have any favorite humans

And parents should love each of their children the same

But Israel did not love all his sons the same

Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons

The brothers of Joseph were jealous that Irael loved Joseph more than them

The brothers of Joseph got angry at Joseph

The brothers of Joseph got so angry at Joseph that they wanted to hurt him

We should never hurt anyone else

We should always love other people

Love does not harm other people

The brothers of Jospeh decided to sell Jospeh as a slave

Then Joseph went to Epypt

Being a slave is very difficult

When Joseph was a slave God was with Joseph

When we have difficulties in our lives, God is always with us

God blessed everything that Joseph did

The master of Joseph had a wife

The wife of the master of Joseph wanted Joseph to sin against her and the master

Joseph refused to sin against his master and the wife of his master

We must always obey God

Even if someone asks us to disobey God we must obey God




Israel lost his favorite son because he had a favorite

If we have an idol it is hurt us
