John 9:39-41 Then Jesus declared, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and those who see may become blind.” Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?” “If you were blind,” Jesus replied, “you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, your guilt remains.”

Jesus said the Pharisees sinned

Jesus told the Pharisees that they claimed to see

When the Pharisees asked "Are we blind too?" they did not believe they were blind

They meant "You cannot mean we are blind, because we know we are not blind"

Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.

We need to try to understand what someone means when they accuse us of sin
