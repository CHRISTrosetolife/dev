Luke 12:4 I tell you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.

Do not be afraid of men

Do not be afraid of people hurting you

People can only kill our bodies

After we are dead, people cannot do anything else to us

2 Timothy 3:12 Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,
2 Timothy 3:13 while evil men and imposters go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.

If we desire to live a godly life, then other people will persecute us

Luke 21:12 But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring you before kings and governors.
Luke 21:13 This will be your opportunity to serve as witnesses.
Luke 21:14 So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how to defend yourselves.
Luke 21:15 For I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.
Luke 21:16 You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death.
Luke 21:17 And you will be hated by everyone because of My name.
Luke 21:18 Yet not even a hair of your head will perish.
Luke 21:19 By your patient endurance you will gain your souls.  

Mark 16:15 And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
Mark 16:16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
Mark 16:17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
Mark 16:18 they will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not harm them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will be made well.”
Mark 16:19 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
Mark 16:20 And they went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked through them, confirming His word by the signs that accompanied it.

We must go into all the world

We must preach the gospel to every creature
