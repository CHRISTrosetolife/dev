If we are persecuted because of righteousness then the kingdom of heaven is ours

If people insult us because of Jesus, then we are blessed

If people persecute us because of Jesus, then we are blessed

If people tell lies about us because of Jesus, then we are blessed

If any of these things happen to us, then God will give us a lot of treasure in heaven

If any of these things happen to us, then we should rejoice!

If any of these things happen to us, then we should be glad!

People insulted, persecuted and lied about the prophets that came before Jesus

So they will do the same to us

2 Timothy 3:12 Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,

If we desire to live a godly life, then other people will persecute us

We remember that if we are persecuted, we are blessed

We are not afraid of people

We are not afraid of people insulting us

We are not afraid of people telling lies about us

We are not afraid of people persecuting us

We are not afraid of people hurting us

People can only kill our bodies

After we are dead, people cannot do anything else to us

People cannot destroy our soul

We are not afraid of dying for Jesus

We are not afraid of what people can do to us

Mark 16:15 And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

If we preach the gospel, we are not afraid of what people can do to us

If we preach the gospel, we are not afraid of people persecuting us

If we preach the gospel, and people persecute us, then our treasure in heaven is great

If we preach the gospel, and people persecute us, then we are blessed
