Luke 12:4 I tell you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.

Do not be afraid of men

Do not be afraid of people hurting you

People can only kill our bodies

After we are dead, people cannot do anything else to us



Mark 16:15 And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
Mark 16:16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
Mark 16:17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
Mark 16:18 they will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not harm them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will be made well.”
Mark 16:19 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
Mark 16:20 And they went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked through them, confirming His word by the signs that accompanied it.

We must go into all the world

We must preach the gospel to every creature
