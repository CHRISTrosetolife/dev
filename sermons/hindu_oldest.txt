As far as I know every religion will claim to be the universal practiced by humans across all human history
If we agree on the length of human history, then every religion will claim to be the same oldness
For example, Jesus did not claim to start a new religion, but to be a fulfillment and continuation of the Jewish religion by claiming to be the Jewish Messiah (And the New Testament is very cohesive with the Old Testament and quotes the Old Testament very extensively - after all the first Christians were Jews who knew the Old Testament)
And Islam does not claim to be started at the time of its prophet, I believe, but goes back through Jesus and John the Baptist they say and then through Ishmael, Abraham and ultimately Adam and Eve
Asking a religion "How long has this religion been practiced?" and more than likely the answer is: "This is the universal religion practiced by all humans throughout history"
Therefore, the claims of the dates of its oral tradition and the dates of its earliest followers may not be helpful to compare who copied who
A separate issue is the age of its religious texts
Clearly the Quran was written later than the Bible
And clearly many of the figures in the Quran were in the Bible, first
According to Wikipedia:
The oldest Hindu text: Rigveda, 1500 â€“ 1100 BCE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Hindu_texts
A quick Google search dated Moses at around 1400 BC
It is said Moses was the first to write down part of the Bible, before then it was oral
1500-1100 is a range and is comparable to 1400
Therefore, from a quick Google search, the Hindu Scriptures are not older than the Christian Scriptures and it is not clear that Moses copied the Hindus
