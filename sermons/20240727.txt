Jesus says to store up treasure in heaven , not treasure on earth

On earth thieves can steal our money , our possessions , our treasure

However God keeps our treasure in heaven safe

There are no thieves or demons that can steal our treasure in heaven

When each of us was born from our mother , we were naked

And , if we die before Jesus comes back , then we will die naked

We cannot bring our houses , our land , our clothes , our possessions , our money on earth to heaven after we die

Jesus says that if we give a cup of cold water to someone in the name of Jesus , that we will not lose our reward

God rewards us even for giving someone a cup of water

If we give someone food who needs it , then God will reward us

Paul says we should know that any good anyone does , he will receive the same from the Lord Jesus

When we do any good , then God pays us back

If we have extra clothes and give some clothes to someone who needs clothes , then God will reward us

If we visit someone who is sick then God will reward us

If we visit a Christian who is in prison then God will reward us

If we do not have any food , water , or clothes to give then we can do good by praying

James says that the prayers of a righteous person are effective

James says Elijah has the same nature as us

Elijah prayed that it would not rain

Then God kept it from raining for three and half years

Then Elijah prayed again and God sent rain

The Prayer of a righteous person is what stopped rain

The Prayer of a righteous person is what started rain

Even if we have nothing to give anyone , we can stil do great good just by praying

When Peter healed a man , he said "in the name of Jesus rise up and walk"

He just said "rise up and walk"

One time Jesus healed just by saying "Be clean"

Jesus stopped the wind and the rain just by saying "Peace, be still"

Jesus said that when we pray we should not be like those who use too many words

We can pray in few words

If we just ask God to heal or protect or save then that is enough words

The power to answer prayer does not come from us

The power to answer prayer comes from God

Because the power comes from God , we do not need pray a very long prayer

And Paul says we do not know how to pray as we ought

And Paul says the Holy Spirit utters groanings too deep for words
