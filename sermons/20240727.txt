Jesus says to store up treasure in heaven , not treasure on earth

On earth thieves can steal our money , our possessions , our treasure

However God keeps our treasure in heaven safe

There are no thieves or demons that can steal our treasure in heaven

When each of us was born from our mother , we were naked

And , if we die before Jesus comes back , then we will die naked

We cannot bring our houses , our land , our clothes , our possessions , our money on earth to heaven after we die

Jesus says that if we give a cup of cold water to someone in the name of Jesus , that we will not lose our reward

God rewards us even for giving someone a cup of water

If we give someone food who needs it , then God will reward us

Paul says we should know that any good anyone does , he will receive the same from the Lord Jesus

When we do any good , then God pays us back
