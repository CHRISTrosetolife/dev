Psalms 18:20 The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.

In Psalms 18, the writer says that they are rewarded for their righteousness

Romans 3:10 As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one.

In Romans, the writer says no one is righteous

If no one is righteous, how can someone be rewarded according to their righteousness?

2 Corinthians 5:20 Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ: Be reconciled to God.
2 Corinthians 5:21 God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.

Jesus Christ knew no sin 

1 Peter 2:21 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in His footsteps:
1 Peter 2:22 “He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in His mouth.”

Jesus Christ committed no sin

No deceit was found in the mouth of Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ was, is and always will be perfect and without sin

Galatians 3:22 But the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin, so that by faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe.

Scripture has confined all to sin

Genesis 6:9 This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.

The Bible calls Noah "righteous"

The Bible calls Noah "blameless"

2 Peter 2:7 and if He rescued Lot, a righteous man distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless

The Bible calls Lot "righteous"

You can see the Bible calls some people "righteous"

Ezekiel 14:20 then as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they could not deliver their own sons or daughters. Their righteousness could deliver only themselves.

Job is a real person along with Noah and Daniel

Job 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil.

The Bible calls Job "blameless"

You can see the Bible calls some people "blameless"

Romans 5:7 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.

Only a few people would be willing to die for a righteous person

Some people would be willing to die for a good person

Therefore, some people are "righteous" and "blameless" 

And some people are even "good"

However, remember Scripture has confined all to sin

Therefore all of these "righteous," "blameless" and "good" people have sinned

Only Jesus is without sin

1 John 1:10 If we say we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a liar, and His word is not in us.

And if we say we have never sinned we make God to be a liar

Romans 3:10 As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one.

Therefore when it says there is no one who is righteous that means no one is perfectly righteous without any sin whatsoever

When it says Lot was "righteous" then that means Lot had sinned before

Therefore the word "righteous" has multiple meanings depending on what's being emphasized

"Righteous" can mean they have much righteousness like Lot and Noah

Here, their goodness is being emphasized

"Righteous" can mean they are perfect like Jesus the righteous dying for the unrighteous or there is none righteous

Here, falling short of perfect righteousness is being emphasized

1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit,

Peter says the "righteous" died for the "unrighteous"

In that context we're all unrighteous

In the womb there was a point where neither Jacob nor Esau had done anything good or evil yet

Therefore some people are too young to sin

Or maybe their mind is incapable of sinning because they have a childlike mind

God will repay us for our works

If we are in Christ we will be rewarded for the good we do

We will be rewarded for any righteousness we have

And our good works are called the fruit of the Spirit

Any fruit of the Spirit is good

It's perfect

Someone may be a sinner as well

And that's works of their flesh

But the fruit of the Spirit God gives us is truly good

We do true good if we are a good tree

Good trees bear good fruit

Genesis 6:9 This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.

Job 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil.

Matthew 7:17 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
