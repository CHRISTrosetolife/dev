Psalms 18:20 The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.

In Psalms 18, the writer says that they are rewarded for their righteousness

Romans 3:10 As it is written: â€œThere is no one righteous, not even one.

In Romans, the writer says no one is righteous

If no one is righteous, how can someone be rewarded according to their righteousness?

Galatians 3:22 But the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin, so that by faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe.

Scripture has confined all to sin

Genesis 6:9 This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.

The Bible calls Noah "righteous"

The Bible calls Noah "blameless"

2 Peter 2:7 and if He rescued Lot, a righteous man distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless

The Bible calls Lot "righteous"

You can see the Bible calls some people "righteous"

Ezekiel 14:20 then as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they could not deliver their own sons or daughters. Their righteousness could deliver only themselves.

Job is a real person along with Noah and Daniel

Job 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil.

The Bible calls Job "blameless"

You can see the Bible calls some people "blameless"

Romans 5:7 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.

Only a few people would be willing to die for a righteous person

Some people would be willing to die for a good person

Therefore, some people are "righteous" and "blameless" 

And some people are even "good"

However, remember Scripture has confined all to sin

Therefore all of these "righteous," "blameless" and "good" people have sinned

1 John 1:10 If we say we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a liar, and His word is not in us.

And if we say we have never sinned we make him a liar

Therefore when it says none are righteous that means perfectly righteous

And when it says Lot was righteous then he sinned

Therefore the word righteous has multiple meanings depending on what's being emphasized

Peter says the righteous died for the unrighteous

In that context we're all unrighteous

In the womb there was a point where neither Jacob nor Esau had done anything good or evil yet

Therefore some people are too young to sin

Or maybe their mind is incapable of sinning because they have a childlike mind

God will repay us for our works

If we are in Christ we will be rewarded for the good we do

We will be rewarded for any righteousness we have

And our good works are called the fruit of the Spirit

Any fruit of the Spirit is good

It's perfect

Someone may be a sinner as well

And that's works of their flesh

But the fruit of the Spirit God gives us is truly good

We do true good if we are a good tree

Good trees bear good fruit

Genesis 6:9 This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.

Job 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil.

Matthew 7:17 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
