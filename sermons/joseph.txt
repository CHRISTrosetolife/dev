There was a man named Jacob

Jacob had 12 sons

One of the sons was named Judah

King David is a descendant of Judah

Jesus is a descendant of King David and of Judah

Judah had a brother named Joseph

Jacob loved Joseph more than all his other children

Jacob treated his other sons poorly

Because of this, the brothers of Joseph wanted to kill him

The brothers of Joseph sold Joseph into slavery

Because Jacob did not treat his children fairly, his children got jealous of Joseph

Then Jacob lost Joseph

Jacob lost his favorite son

If we love something other than God too much, then God will take it away from us if that is good for us

It's important we love God the most

Everything that God created is a gift

We do not worship what God has created

We only worship God who created everything

Joseph was about 17 years old when his brothers sold him into slavery

Then Joseph was a slave

Joseph was young when Joseph became a slave

Joseph did not do anything wrong

But Joseph lost his whole family

Joseph lost his father Jacob and his mother and all his brothers

Joseph had to move far away to Egypt and learn a new language

Joseph lost everything and didn't do anything wrong

Sometimes God allows us to suffer a whole lot that we do not deserve

Later Joseph told his brothers: when you sold me into slavery, you did me evil

But God was doing me good

The New Testament says in the book of Romans that all things work together for good to them that love God and are called according to the purpose of God

No matter what bad that is happening to you right now

No matter what bad will happen to you in the future

God will make it good by the time it is over

When Joseph became a slave, God was with Joseph

So Joseph was prosperous and successful in everything he did

And then Joseph was in charge of the house of his master

However the wife of the master of Joseph said Joseph did really bad

But Joseph didn't do anything bad

Instead the wife was trying to do bad
