1 Corthinians 1:1 says:

1 Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes

In the Bible, Paul and Sosthenes are the authors of 1 Corinthians

1 Corithinians has many verses about marriage including verses specifically about women

For example:

1 Corinthians 7:13
If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.

Paul says that Paul was single when he asks the following question:

1 Corinthians 9:5
Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?

The apostle Paul writes about marriage many times, not just in 1 Corinthians

Even though Paul was single, Paul still taught about marriage

And even though Paul was a man, Paul still taught about women

Therefore God can use a man to teach about women or marriage



In the Bible the book of Proverbs has 31 chapters

In the last chapter, there are many verses about women specifically

For example verse 30 of chapter 31 of Proverbs says:

Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
    but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.

In the whole Bible there are many verses about women specifically

And yet the Bible also says this:

Galatians 3:28
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

In Christ, there are no races like Jew or Greek

In Christ, there are no social statuses, like slave or free

In Christ, there is not male and female

The is because we are all one in Christ

And yet the Bible addresses servants and masters individually

Therefore these differences exist today

However what makes us united is greater than what makes us different

We are all united because we are one in Christ

Therefore, for the Christian being a Christian is more fundamental than being a man or a woman

Our primary identity is that we belong to Christ

Our primary identity is not that we are a man or a woman, or our race or our social status

Therefore a message to Christian women is primarily to a Christian, and gender is secondary



So, what does the Bible have to say to Christians?

Matthew 4:4
But he answered, “It is written, “‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”

We humans live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God

What words proceed out of the mouth of God?

2 Timothy 3:16
All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,

If something is Scripture, then it is breathed out of the mouth of God

If it is breathed out of the mouth of God, then it proceeds out of the mouth of God

Therefore all Scripture proceeds out of the mouth of God

Therefore when Jesus says humans live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, humans live by all Scripture

Therefore, every word in the Bible is written for Christians


But where do we begin?

What Scripture do we start with, first?

Galatians 1
1 Paul, an apostle—not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—

Paul wrote Galatians

Galatians 1
11 For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. 12 For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 

Paul received the gospel through a revelation from Jesus

1 Corinthians 15:3-4
3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,

Christ died 

Christ died for our sins

Then Christ was buried

Then Christ rose to life

The death, burial and resurrection of Jesus is a revelation from Jesus to Paul

Paul delivered this revelation to the Corinthians

Paul delivered this relevation as of first importance

This revelation is of first importance

The death, burial and resurrection of Jesus is of first importance

Therefore we begin with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus

A resurrection can only happen if there is first a death

If someone were to briefly die and be resurrected, many people would not think the person died

Since their death would not be proven, their resurrection would not be proven, either

But if someone were to die, and be buried for at least a few days, then clearly they are dead

And then, when they resurrect, the resurrection is proven because their death is also proven

The death and burial are needed to prove Jesus rose to life



Why is it important that Jesus rose to life?

11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed. 

Paul and the other apostles preached that Jesus rose to life

12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 

When Paul wrote 1 Corithians there were people who said they were believers in God, but also taught that there was no resurrection of the dead

Paul asks: if the apostles proclaim that Jesus rose from the dead, how can people say there is no resurrection of the dead?

Paul means that if Jesus rose from the dead, then there must be a resurrection of the dead

13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 

Paul says if no dead person has ever been resurrected, then it would have been impossible for Jesus to have risen from the dead

1 Kings 17:17–24
17 After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill. And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. 

There was a woman

The woman had a son

The son became sick

And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. 

The son was so sick, the son could not breathe

Because the son could not breathe, the son died

18 And she said to Elijah, “What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son!” 19 And he said to her, “Give me your son.” And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged, and laid him on his own bed. 20 And he cried to the Lord, “O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?” 21 Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the Lord, “O Lord my God, let this child's life[a] come into him again.” 22 And the Lord listened to the voice of Elijah. And the life of the child came into him again, and he revived. 23 And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and delivered him to his mother. And Elijah said, “See, your son lives.” 24 And the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.”




14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. 15 We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. 16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 19 If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.

20 But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. 23 But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. 24 Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. 25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death. 27 For “God[c] has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him. 28 When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.
