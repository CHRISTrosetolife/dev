Hebrews 9:27-28 Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment, so also Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await Him.

There is a judgmnet after death

2 Corinthians 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive his due for the things done in the body, whether good or bad.

Everyone including Paul and the other apostles must come before the judgmnet seat of Christ

Romans 2:6-8 God “will repay each one according to his deeds.” To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.

God repays us according to our deeds and works

give account for every idle word and teaching

Matthew 12:36 But I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.
