Hebrews 9:27-28 Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment, so also Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await Him.

There is a judgmnet after death

God repays us according to our deeds and works

Matthew 7:21 Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven.

It is not enough to call Jesus "Lord"

We must do the will of the Father of Jesus in heaven
