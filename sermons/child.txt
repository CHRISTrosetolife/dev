if you look down toward your feet , you will see the earth

GOD created the earth

if you look up , you will see the sky

GOD created the sky and everything past the sky

GOD created the heavens

GOD created water

GOD created the ocean and rivers

GOD created plants

GOD created animals

GOD created fish in the water

GOD created birds in the sky

GOD created insects bugs

and GOD created humans

GOD created everything

because GOD is the CREATOR , GOD knows best

GOD knows the way things should be better than anyone else

the first two humans GOD created were a husband and a wife named adam and eve

GOD created a garden for adam and eve to live in

in the garden were different trees

trees had fruit that could be eaten

GOD said there was one tree that adam and eve could not eat from 

this tree was called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil

however adam and eve disobeyed GOD 

adam and eve sinned

adam and eve ate from the tree they should not eat

because adam and eve ate the fruit , they were cursed

instead of having an easy life in the garden , adam was cursed to work hard and sweat for food

eve was cursed to have adam rule over eve and to have painful childbirth

today GOD commands us to love each other

if we disobey GOD then something bad will eventually happen

we must always obey GOD

the bible tells us what GOD says

the bible says for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of GOD

that means that humans disobey GOD

if we think we have never disobeyed GOD in our lives , we have disobeyed GOD

if we have disobeyed GOD , that makes us a sinner

if we have disobeyed GOD , we need forgiveness

the bible says without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins

GOD sent HIS SON into the world

about 2,000 years ago there was a woman named mary

mary had a child named JESUS

most children have a dad and a mom

JESUS only had a mom

JESUS is the SON of GOD

JESUS lived a perfect life

when JESUS lived , the government of rome ruled over the people

the romans killed criminals by hanging criminals on a cross of wood until the criminal died

then , when JESUS was about 33 years old , the government said that JESUS did wrong , but JESUS did not do wrong

the government said JESUS must die

JESUS died on a cross , which is how the roman government killed criminals 

then JESUS was buried in a tomb

then , on the third day after JESUS died , JESUS rose to life

then shortly afterward , JESUS went up into heaven

the bible says the wages of sin is death

us sinners deserve to have an eternal death

JESUS did not deserve to die at all

JESUS died in our place

JESUS obeyed GOD the FATHER , even to death on a cross

therefore GOD gave JESUS a name above all other names

and JESUS is LORD forevermore

the bible says if we confess with our mouth the LORD JESUS and believe in our heart that GOD raised JESUS from the dead , we shall be saved

GOD we confess that JESUS is LORD

GOD we believe in our hearts that GOD raised JESUS from the dead 

GOD please save us amen
