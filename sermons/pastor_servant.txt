Mark 10:42 So Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority over them.     
Mark 10:43 But it shall not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
Mark 10:44 and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.
Mark 10:45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” 

In the nations, out in the world, people who are great command other people

In the nations, out in the world, people who are great are masters over other people

But this is not true for Christians

If a Christian wants to be great, they should not command others

Instead, if a Christian wants to be great, they should allow others to command them

If a Christian wants to be great, they should not be a master over other people

Instead, if a Christian wants to be great, they should allow all other Christians to be their master

If a Christian wants to be great, they should be a servant to everyone else

Jesus did not come so that people would serve Jesus while Jesus was on earth

Instead, Jesus came to so that Jesus would serve everyone

Jesus is Servant of all

If we want to be like Jesus, we must be a servant to everyone else
