Mark 10:42 So Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority over them.     
Mark 10:43 But it shall not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
Mark 10:44 and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.
Mark 10:45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” 

In the nations, out in the world, people who are great command other people

In the nations, out in the world, people who are great are masters over other people

But this is not true for Christians

If a Christian wants to be great, they should not command others

Instead, if a Christian wants to be great, they should allow others to command them

If a Christian wants to be great, they should not be a master over other people

Instead, if a Christian wants to be great, they should allow all other Christians to be their master

If a Christian wants to be great, they should be a servant to everyone else

Jesus did not come so that people would serve Jesus while Jesus was on earth

Instead, Jesus came to so that Jesus would serve everyone

Jesus is Servant of all

John 13:34 A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also must love one another.      
John 13:35 By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another.”

As Jesus loved, we ought to love as well

Our love for each other is how everyone will know that we are disciples of Jesus

If we want to be love like Jesus, we must be a servant to everyone else

1 Corinthians 9:19 Though I am free of obligation to anyone, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.

Paul was not an earthly slave

Paul did not have an earthly master

Paul was free on earth

However, Paul became a servant to everyone

This was so Paul could win people to become saved

1 Corinthians 9:20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), to win those under the law.
1 Corinthians 9:21 To those without the law I became like one without the law (though I am not outside the law of God but am under the law of Christ), to win those without the law.
1 Corinthians 9:22 To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.

When Paul talked to Jews, Paul lived like a Jew

When Paul talked to who obeyed the law of Moses, Paul lived as if he obeyed the law of Moses

However Paul was not under the law of Moses

This was to save people who obeyed the law of Moses

When Paul talked to those who did not have the law of God, Paul lived like someone who did not have the law of God

However Paul was not outside the law of God

Paul was under the law of Christ

This was to save people who did not have the law of God

When Paul talked to weak people, Paul lived as though Paul was weak

Paul because everything to everyone

Paul adapted to the preferences of people to save them

Paul did not sin against God to become everything to everyone

This is one way Paul served everyone

Pastors should serve the people they want to God to save

Philippians 2:3 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves.

We should not live out of selfish ambition

We should not live out of pride

Instead we should live out of humility

If we are humble, then we will consider others more important than ourselves

If we consider others more important than ourselves, then it will be easy for us to serve them
