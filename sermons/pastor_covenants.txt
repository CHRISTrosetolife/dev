Galatians 4:22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.

Abraham

Galatians 4:23 His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born through the promise.
Galatians 4:24 These things serve as illustrations, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children into slavery: This is Hagar.
Galatians 4:25 Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.
Galatians 4:26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
Galatians 4:27 For it is written: “Rejoice, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have never travailed; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.”
Galatians 4:28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
Galatians 4:29 At that time, however, the son born by the flesh persecuted the son born by the Spirit. It is the same now.
Galatians 4:30 But what does the Scripture say? “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”
Galatians 4:31 Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
