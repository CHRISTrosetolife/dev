Genesis 17:5 No longer will you be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.

The name of Abraham used to be Abram

Genesis 16:1 Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.
Genesis 16:2 So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.

Sarai was the wife of Abram

Sarai had no children

Hagar was the servant of Sarai

So Sarai said Abram should have a child with Hagar

Genesis 16:15 And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.

Abram and Hagar had a son named Ishmael

Genesis 17:15 Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, do not call her Sarai, for her name is to be Sarah.

The name of Sarah used to be Sarai

Genesis 17:19 But God replied, “Your wife Sarah will indeed bear you a son, and you are to name him Isaac. I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.

Sarah was the wife of Abraham

Abraham and Sarah had a son named Isaac

Ishmael and Isaac were the first two sons of Abraham

Genesis 23:1 Now Sarah lived to be 127 years old.
Genesis 23:2 She died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went out to mourn and to weep for her.

In Genesis 23, Sarah died

Genesis 25:1 Now Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah,
Genesis 25:2 and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

In Genesis 25, Abraham got a new wife

Abraham had a wife named Keturah

Keturah gave Abraham six sons

Genesis 25:6 But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.

Abraham also had concubines

The concubines of Abraham had sons

Abraham had many sons

Galatians 4:22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.

In Galatians 4, Paul talks about two of the sons that Abraham had

The slave woman is Hagar

The free woman is Sarah

The slave woman had Ishmael

The free woman had Isaac

Galatians 4:23 His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born through the promise.

When Abraham had a child with Hagar, Abraham was trying to fulfill the promise of God through the flesh of Abraham

Galatians 4:24 These things serve as illustrations, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children into slavery: This is Hagar.
Galatians 4:25 Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.
Galatians 4:26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
Galatians 4:27 For it is written: “Rejoice, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have never travailed; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.”
Galatians 4:28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
Galatians 4:29 At that time, however, the son born by the flesh persecuted the son born by the Spirit. It is the same now.
Galatians 4:30 But what does the Scripture say? “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”
Galatians 4:31 Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
