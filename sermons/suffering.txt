james 1:2-4
Consider it pure joy, my brothers, when you encounter trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Allow perseverance to finish its work, so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.

we go through trials and difficulties in life

GOD uses our trials and difficulties in life to test our faith

when our faith is tested , then GOD gives us perseverance

when GOD gives us perseverance then GOD makes us perfect and complete

when we are perfect and complete we have all the spiritual gifts that we need

this is from hebrews 12:2-11

our eyes should be fixed on JESUS

we should remember JESUS

we should remember the cross and death of JESUS

we should meditate on JESUS

we should meditate on the suffering of JESUS

JESUS was a man of sorrows

when JESUS prayed in the garden , his disciples fell asleep and JESUS prayed alone

when JESUS was on the cross JESUS cried out "my GOD my GOD why have you forsaken me"

on the cross JESUS was forsaken

JESUS suffered much

we are glorified together with CHRIST provided that we suffer with CHRIST

JESUS is the author of our faith

JESUS is the source and cause and beginning of our faith

JESUS is the perfecter of our faith

JESUS is the finisher of our faith

JESUS is the ONE who brings our faith to completion

JESUS had to suffer on the cross for our sins

JESUS endured the cross because of the joy that JESUS knew would come later

after JESUS endured the cross , JESUS rose to life and ascended into heaven

GOD has a throne in heaven

sitting at the right hand is a place of honor

when JESUS ascended into heaven , JESUS sat down at the right hand of the throne of GOD

many people made JESUS suffer

the solidiers gave JESUS a crown of thorns

the soldiers struck JESUS

the soldiers mocked JESUS

when we suffer , we should remember how JESUS suffered

when we remember that JESUS suffered a lot then we will be encouraged about our own suffering

JESUS endured the suffering of JESUS

if JESUS endured the suffering of JESUS , then we can endure our own suffering

GOD counts some people worthy to have their blood shed because of JESUS

we struggle against sin

many people have not yet had their blood shed because they were obeying GOD

if GOD loves us , then GOD will discipline us

if we are children of GOD , then GOD will chastise us

we all suffer

when we suffer in our lives , then GOD is disciplining us

when we suffer , that means that we are children of GOD

on earth fathers discipline their children

if GOD were to not discipline someone , then they would not be true children of GOD

we respect our fathers on earth when they disciplined us when we were children

how much more should we respect our HEAVENLY FATHER when HE disciplines us

when GOD disciplines us , it leads to eternal life

we submit to GOD

earthly fathers who are sinners discipline their children the best they can

GOD disciplines us to help us perfectly

we are to be holy because GOD is holy

GOD disciplines us so that we can share in the holiness of GOD

every time GOD disciplines us , it feels painful when it happens

after GOD disciplines us we obey GOD even more
