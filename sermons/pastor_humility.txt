1 Peter 5:1-3 As a fellow elder, a witness of Christ’s sufferings, and a partaker of the glory to be revealed, I appeal to the elders among you: Be shepherds of God’s flock that is among you, watching over them not out of compulsion, but because it is God’s will; not out of greed, but out of eagerness; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.

God entrusts a flock to a shepherd

Someone who lords over someone else forces them to obey through power, authority and commanding

God does not want shepherds to lead this way

Instead, this means that shepherds lead by example

Shepherds obey God

The flock watches the shepherd

The flock sees the shepherd obeying God

The flock imitates the shepherd obeying God

Paul says:

1 Corinthians 11:1 You are to imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.

Then as the shepherd obeys God and the flock imitates the shepherd, then the flock obeys God
