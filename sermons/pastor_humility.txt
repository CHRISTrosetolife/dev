God entrusts a flock to a shepherd

Someone who lords over someone else forces them to obey through power, authority and commanding

God does not want shepherds to lead this way

Instead, this means that shepherds lead by example

Shepherds obey God

The flock watches the shepherd

The flock sees the shepherd obeying God

The flock imitates the shepherd, who obeys God

Paul says:


Then as the shepherd obeys God then as the flock imitates the shepherd the flock obeys God

A shepherd not feel forced themselves to be a shepherd; they should not feel compulsed

Instead a shepherd should shepherd because of their desire to obey the will of God

A shepherd should not be a shepherd to make money

A shepherd should be eager to be a shepherd




Onesimus was a slave of Philemon

Onesimus ran away

Paul was in prison

Onesimus served Paul

Paul wanted to keep Onesimus

But then Philemon was not consenting to his slave Onesimus serving Paul

Then the good Philemon was doing through his slave Onesimus serving Paul would be out of compulsion and forced

Paul wanted the good Philemon to do to be out of the free will of Philemon

Paul was not lording over Philemon

Paul was not forcing Philemon

Paul gave Philemon freedom

Paul was bold enough that Paul could command Philemon in the name of Jesus to receive Onesimus back

However, instead of commanding using his apostolic authority, Paul appealed to Philemon to receive Onesimus back

Paul is an example of a shepherd who is not lording over his flock

Galatians 2:7-8 On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted to preach the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised. For the One who was at work in Peterâ€™s apostleship to the circumcised was also at work in my apostleship to the Gentiles.
