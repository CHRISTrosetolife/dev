The heavens are higher than the earth

And so the ways and thoughts of God are higher than the thoughts and ways of man

God alone is wise

God knows everything

God is love

God loves the world that he created

Everything God commands us to do is because God loves us

Jesus Christ did not please himself, but pleased others

Love does what it is best for others

God commands us to do what is best for us

It is best for us if we obey the commands of God

Sometimes the commands of God do not make sense to us

We remember that the ways and thoughts of God are above us

When the commands of God do not make sense to us, we must trust what God says instead of what we think or feel

Jesus says we must take up our cross daily and follow Jesus

Every day we must take up our cross of suffering

Every day we must suffer as Christians

Our suffering prepares us for an eternal weight of glory

We are glorified with Christ provided we suffer with him

Our suffering leads to glory

Suffering also leads to righteousness

Our trials lead to perseverance, perfection and completion

Our suffering is good for us

Sin is pleasurable for a seasons, but leads to death later

Righteousness has temporary suffering, but leads to joy and glory later
