The heavens are higher than the earth

And so the ways and thoughts of God are higher than the thoughts and ways of man

God alone is wise

God knows everything

God is love

God loves the world that he created

Everything God commands us to do is because God loves us

Jesus Christ did not please himself, but pleased others

Love does what it is best for others

God commands us to do what is best for us

It is best for us if we obey the commands of God

Sometimes the commands of God do not make sense to us

We remember that the ways and thoughts of God are above us

When the commands of God do not make sense to us, we must trust what God says instead of what we think or feel

Jesus says we must take up our cross daily and follow Jesus

Every day we must take up our cross of suffering

God disciplines all of His children

God allows all of His children to suffer on earth

Every day we must suffer as Christians

Our suffering prepares us for an eternal weight of glory

We are glorified with Christ provided we suffer with him

Our suffering leads to glory

Suffering also leads to righteousness

Our trials lead to perseverance, perfection and completion

Our suffering is good for us

Sin is pleasurable for a seasons, but leads to eternal death later

Righteousness has temporary suffering, but leads to eternal joy and glory later

We should choose eternal joy and glory over eternal death

Therefore we must choose the temporary suffering of righteousness rather than the temporary pleasure of sin

Jesus commands us to love like Jesus did

Jesus laid down His life for us

Therefore we should lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters in Christ

We should esteem others better than ourselves

We should be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger

Matthew 10:37-39
Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

We must love Jesus more than our father

We must love Jesus more than our mother

We must love Jesus more than our children

If someone does not take up their cross and follow Jesus, they are not worthy of Jesus

If someone lives how they want and disobeys God, God will punish them

If someone submits to God and lives how God wants to, God will reward them

Luke 14:33
So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.

We must not consider anything we have to belong to us, but belong to God

Our money belongs to God, not us

Our land belongs to God, not us

Our house belongs to God, not us

Our food and water belongs to God, not us

Our own bodies do not belong to God, but us

Therefore, to be a Christian, we must give up everything and follow Jesus

It is difficult to give up everything and follow Jesus

We cannot give up everything and follow Jesus by ourselves in our own strength

Through Jesus and through the power of the Holy Spirit we can obey what God commands

Yes, if we give up everything and follow Jesus, we will suffer, but suffering is temporary

Joy and glory is eternal

Yes, when we give up everything and follow Jesus, it may not make sense to us, but remember that God knows better than we do
