pray always

give account for every idle word and teaching

humility to lead

servant like Jesus

count others better

proverbs listening to counsel

quick to listen slow to speak

Heavenly Father, give me the words to say; open up our eyes and ears to scripture and truth;

1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.
