pray always

give account for every idle word and teaching

humility to lead

servant like Jesus

count others better

proverbs listening to counsel

quick to listen slow to speak

---

Heavenly Father, give me the words to say; open up our eyes and ears to scripture and truth; prepare the hearts of everyone to receive the word of God

1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.

We should always pray

Hebrews 1:1 On many past occasions and in many different ways, God spoke to our fathers through the prophets. But in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He made the universe.

Before Jesus, in the days of the Old Testament, God spoke through prophets

Therefore the Old Testament was written by prophets

Romans 8:9 You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.

The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God

1 Peter 1:10-11 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who foretold the grace to come to you searched and investigated carefully, trying to determine the time and setting to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.

The prophets who wrote the Old Testament were speaking by the Spirit of Christ

Therefore the Old Testament comes from the Spirit of God

1 Corinthians 2:14 The natural man does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God. For they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

The things that come from the Spirit of God are spiritually discerned
