1 Corinthians 14:26 What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a psalm or a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. All of these must be done to build up the church.
1 Corinthians 14:27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, two, or at most three, should speak in turn, and someone must interpret.
1 Corinthians 14:28 But if there is no interpreter, he should remain silent in the church and speak only to himself and God.
1 Corinthians 14:29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
1 Corinthians 14:30 And if a revelation comes to someone who is seated, the first speaker should stop.
1 Corinthians 14:31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
1 Corinthians 14:32 The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
1 Corinthians 14:33 For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace as in all the churches of the saints.
1 Corinthians 14:34 Women are to be silent in the churches. They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says.
1 Corinthians 14:35 If they wish to inquire about something, they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is dishonorable for a woman to speak in the church.
1 Corinthians 14:36 Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
1 Corinthians 14:37 If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, let him acknowledge that what I am writing you is the Lordâ€™s command.
1 Corinthians 14:38 But if anyone ignores this, he himself will be ignored.
1 Corinthians 14:39 So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 
1 Corinthians 14:40 But everything must be done in a proper and orderly manner.
